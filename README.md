# NoobPyTrade

A pretty intro level and basic trading strategy using ML, primarily LSTM and backtesting.

A zerodha account will be required for having a client id for API calls.

Given that we're working with kiteconnect, an INR 4k/month investment is required from the user's side. 2k for app creation and 2k for obtaining historic data.

The API key and API secret you'll get need to be stored in a secure location as these will be used for API calls down the line.

Keep trading symbol variants in mind before proceeding.

Finally, if you're looking for a profit making machine that basically lets you live trading life on autopilot then this really isn't for you as I worked with dummy data inputs and didn't see many promising results, but as a project, this helped me test my ML skills on real world scenarios.
